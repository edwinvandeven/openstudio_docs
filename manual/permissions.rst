Permissions
============================

OpenStudio supports a role based access system. This page lists the minimum required permissions for certain features.
Permissions are set on a group and granted by adding studio staff to a group. Currently only a single group can be assigned to an account.

To set permissions, navigate the following menus in the backend: Settings -> Access -> Groups -> Click the *permissions* button for the group you'd like to assign permissions.
