Customers
==========

Most customer related administrative activities start at the Customers -> List Customers page.

From the Customer List page you can view a list of your customers, search your
list of customers, add new customers and export Customer Records and Mailing
Lists to Excel Spreadsheet format.


1. Adding Customers
----------------------

    Click the +Add button at the top right of the Customer List window.  In add
    customer popup, input the First Name, Last Name and email address of the student.
      The email address will become their customer login username in case you
      choose to have your customers participate in the use of OpenStudio.


2. Export Customer Data
--------------------------------------------

    You can export and download Customer Records and Mailing lists to
    Excel Spreadsheet format from Customers -> List Customers page by clicking
    on the small Cloud button near the top right of the window.


3. Search for customers in list
----------------------------------

    In order to more quickly and easily locate a customer from your customer list,
    you can begin typing the customers name in the search box near the top right
    of the Customer List window.  As you type, the list will refine itself with each keystroke.

    When using the search feature, be sure to clear the contents of the search box
    after locating your customer or you will continue to see a filtered list.
    It is not uncommon to encounter difficulty locating records or fear loss of
    data when the list is merely filtered.

4. # of records to view in Customer List
------------------------------------------

    By default, lists display 10 records per page.  You can select between
    10, 15 or 25 records per page.  You can do so by clicking on the square button
    with eye symbol near the top of the page.



5. Send e-mail
--------------

    Clicking on the envelop to the right side of a customer in the list will open
    a new email with the recipient email address already populated in the default
    email client, if installed and/or defined in the users operating system.

6. Edit
------------

    You can select the student record you wish to edit by clikcing on their picture icon,
    or by clicking pencil icon button to the right of the students record.
    More about editing customer records below under the Customers Record section.


7. Delete
--------------

    If you want to remove a customer from this list, you would click on the X
    icon Button to the right of the customer record.  The customer record will
    be moved to the 'Deleted' tab.  Customer records can not be removed from the
    database because their may be many transactions linked to that customer record.
    When records are deleted, they are instead marked as deleted and removed from
    active view.

    When a deleted customer record becomes useful again, such as when the customer
    resumes classes, their record can be active again by removing it from the deleted tab.
